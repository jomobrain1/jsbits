            Oh, and for people who are gonna sit and whine that life ain’t fair - my response, “You are right - life’s an asshole that will bend you over and fuck you without even a curtesy reach around - and will kick you in the nuts once it’s done - but, that’s life, deal with it, or, sit on the couch, whine and cry, and end up coming to nothing because you are 2 busy being an entitled prick to actually ever meet life on your own terms”
